We want to aggregate a large number of tweets and investigate a variety of questions:

- does a random collection of tweets follow Zipf's Law? (aka do the frequencies, when ranked, follow an exponential distribution?)
- if not, does a geographically grouped collection of tweets follow Zipf's Law (local lingo?)
- if not, does a single user's collection of tweets follow Zipf's Law? (perhaps that user has his/her own "language")
- if not, what kind of distribution do these ranked frequencies follow?  is this distribution similar when separating by geographic area?  by user?
- how can we compare a user's personal "language" to different dialects of English?
    - could we try "translating" a text in English to a user's own personal language based on word counts?
